# MMI_ARNavigation_POC_ARDK

This project demonstrates the development of an AR navigation app in Unity using Niantic Lightship ARDK and the Pedestrian Route API from Mappls API. The app combines augmented reality features with real-time pedestrian route guidance to provide an immersive and interactive navigation experience.

## Features

- Real-time positioning using GPS, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth for accurate user location tracking.
- Integration with Niantic Lightship ARDK for AR functionality, allowing virtual objects to be overlaid onto the camera feed.
- Integration with Mappls Pedestrian Route API to calculate pedestrian-friendly routes between locations.
- Display of turn-by-turn directions and points of interest (POI) markers overlaid on the camera view in augmented reality.
- Interactive and intuitive AR navigation experience for users.
