# AR Navigation App using Niantic Lightship ARDK and Pedestrian Route API

This project demonstrates the development of an AR navigation app in Unity using Niantic Lightship ARDK and the Pedestrian Route API from Mapbox API. The app combines augmented reality features with real-time pedestrian route guidance to provide an immersive and interactive navigation experience.

## Features

- Real-time positioning using GPS, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth for accurate user location tracking.
- Integration with Niantic Lightship ARDK for AR functionality, allowing virtual objects to be overlaid onto the camera feed.
- Integration with Mapbox Pedestrian Route API to calculate pedestrian-friendly routes between locations.
- Display of turn-by-turn directions and points of interest (POI) markers overlaid on the camera view in augmented reality.
- Interactive and intuitive AR navigation experience for users.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following:

- Unity 3D (version X.X.X)
- Niantic Lightship ARDK (version X.X.X)
- Mapbox API key (sign up at https://www.mapbox.com/ and obtain an API key)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.


2. Open the project in Unity.

3. Import the Niantic Lightship ARDK package into the Unity project.

4. Create a new script for handling AR navigation functionality.

5. Implement the necessary code to handle real-time positioning, route calculation, and AR overlay.

6. Obtain a Mapbox API key and configure it in your Unity project.

7. Build and run the app on your target device.
